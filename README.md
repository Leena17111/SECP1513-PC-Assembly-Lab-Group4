## üõ†Ô∏è Key Takeaways

### **1. Disassembly and Exploration**
Using the appropriate tools, we carefully disassembled the PC and studied components such as:
- **Power Supply Unit (PSU):**  
  - Learned how it distributes power to various parts of the system and its wiring connections.
- **Hard Disk Drive (HDD):**  
  - Understood its role in data storage and how it interfaces with the motherboard.
- **RAM:**  
  - Examined its capacity and role in system performance, as well as its physical installation process.
- **Cooling System:**  
  - Observed the arrangement of fans and heat sinks and their role in maintaining system stability.

### **2. Reassembly and Testing**
After completing the disassembly process, we:
- Reinstalled the components in their correct positions.
- Ensured all connections were secure and properly managed for airflow and organization.
- Conducted a functionality test to confirm that the system was operational post-reassembly.

### **3. Hardware Quiz**
The session concluded with a quiz that tested:
- Knowledge of component functions and proper handling techniques.
- Understanding of disassembly and reassembly steps.
- Basic troubleshooting skills for common PC hardware issues.
